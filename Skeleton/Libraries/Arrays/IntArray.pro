;Returns the integral of the array Y, calculated by
;linear interpolation of the data
;The array must be twodimensional, the integration is
;performed along the second dimension
;X is supposed to be an vector of length n,
;Y is supposed to be an array with n_elements(Y[0,*])==n
;return value is an Array with 1 dimension
